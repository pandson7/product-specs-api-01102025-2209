# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a Product Specifications API that provides access to product data stored in a flexible JSON format. The system will support retrieving product information including name, category, brand, and other dynamic attributes through RESTful API endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store product specifications in a flexible JSON format, so that I can accommodate varying product attributes without schema constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL support flexible JSON schema with dynamic attributes
2. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL include core fields: product name, category, brand
3. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL allow additional custom attributes per product
4. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL assign unique identifiers to each product

### Requirement 2: API Access to Product Data
**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve product specifications via REST API, so that I can display product information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a GET request is made to /products THE SYSTEM SHALL return all products in JSON format
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /products/{id} THE SYSTEM SHALL return a specific product by ID
3. WHEN a product is not found THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 404 status
4. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL include proper CORS headers
5. WHEN API responses are returned THE SYSTEM SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3: Sample Data Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample product data to be automatically populated, so that I can test the API functionality immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL populate the database with sample product data
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include diverse product categories
3. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate flexible schema capabilities
4. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include at least 5 different products

### Requirement 4: API Performance and Reliability
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want reliable and performant access to product data, so that my application can provide a good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL handle them without errors
3. WHEN errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL return meaningful error messages
4. WHEN the system is under load THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain availability
