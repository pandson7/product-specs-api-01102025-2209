# Product Specifications API - Project Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a serverless Product Specifications API using AWS CDK that provides access to product data with flexible JSON schema support.

## Architecture
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for product access
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for API logic (3 functions)
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible JSON document storage
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging

## API Endpoints
- `GET /products` - Retrieve all products
- `GET /products/{id}` - Retrieve specific product by ID

**Base URL**: https://qr4vnvsw3i.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/

## Sample Data
Successfully populated with 5 diverse products:
1. MacBook Pro 16-inch (Electronics)
2. Nike Air Max 270 (Footwear)
3. Samsung 55-inch QLED TV (Electronics)
4. Organic Cotton T-Shirt (Clothing)
5. Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 (Kitchen)

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Specifications Created
- [x] requirements.md - User stories with EARS notation
- [x] design.md - Technical architecture and sequence diagrams
- [x] tasks.md - Implementation plan with 10 discrete tasks

### ✅ Architecture Diagram Generated
- [x] product-specs-api-architecture.png - Visual architecture diagram

### ✅ CDK Infrastructure Deployed
- [x] Stack: ProductSpecsApiStack-01102025-2209
- [x] DynamoDB table with flexible JSON support
- [x] 3 Lambda functions (GetProducts, GetProduct, PopulateData)
- [x] API Gateway with CORS enabled
- [x] IAM roles with least privilege access

### ✅ Sample Data Populated
- [x] 5 products with diverse categories
- [x] Flexible JSON schema demonstrated
- [x] All products successfully stored in DynamoDB

### ✅ API Testing Completed
- [x] GET /products returns all products (200 OK)
- [x] GET /products/{id} returns specific product (200 OK)
- [x] GET /products/invalid-id returns 404 error
- [x] CORS headers properly configured

### ✅ GitHub Repository Created
- [x] Repository: https://github.com/pandson7/product-specs-api-01102025-2209
- [x] All project files pushed successfully
- [x] Architecture diagram included
- [x] Proper .gitignore configuration

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Flexible JSON Schema**: Products can have varying attributes
2. **Serverless Architecture**: Cost-effective and scalable
3. **CORS Support**: Ready for web client integration
4. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
5. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs for all Lambda functions
6. **Security**: IAM roles with minimal required permissions

## Performance Characteristics
- API response time: < 2 seconds (requirement met)
- Concurrent request handling: Supported via Lambda scaling
- Database: Pay-per-request billing for cost optimization

## Deployment Information
- **AWS Region**: us-east-1
- **Stack Name**: ProductSpecsApiStack-01102025-2209
- **Deployment Date**: October 2, 2025, 02:17 UTC
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and tested

## Next Steps
The API is ready for integration with client applications. Consider adding:
- Authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting
- Additional CRUD operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Data validation schemas
- Caching layer for improved performance
